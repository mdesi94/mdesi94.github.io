    <p><em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</em> or northern lights, begin high in the
      Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when
      charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic
      field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

<p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
  Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in these
  light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider
  anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your
   magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>

<div class="para3">
<p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter
  nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and
  September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with
  the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in
  September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes.
  Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
