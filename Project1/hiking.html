<p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is
surrounded by some of Iceland’s most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a
glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the
location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with
the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
